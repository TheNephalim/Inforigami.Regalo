# How to Contribute
## How I define "contributing":
* Raising a bug/feature/inspiring anecdote on the issue list.
* Submitting a pull request.
* Sending a patch or code snippet to neil@inforigami.com.
* Telling people about the project.

I'll do any legwork required around formatting or whatever else, I'm just grateful for whatever you can spare.

## So don't
* Waste time looking for coding guidelines (there aren't any); that's my problem not yours.
* Worry particularly about the quality of your patch, as long as it's "finished".

## Please Note
* Some contributions might not meet my "vision" (eugh, sorry) for the project and *might* not make it in. Feel free to maintain a fork though.
* I may change the actual code of any submissions. Please don't be offended, I'm just pleased to have help.
* I will be extremely grateful for any and all input, whether it ends up as part of the code or not.
